## Color Constancy Performance Analysis

### Algorithm Comparison Results

**Performance Summary:**
1. **Max RGB**: 2.338° 
2. **White Patch**: 2.404°
3. **CNN**: 2.659°
4. **Shades of Gray (p=1)**: 3.448°
5. **Robust AWB (95%)**: 4.252°
6. **Gray World**: 4.636°
7. **Robust AWB (90%)**: 5.347°
8. **Edge-based**: 7.746°

### Key Findings

1. **Classical methods outperform basic CNN**: Max RGB and White Patch achieve better results than the current CNN implementation.

2. **Target not achieved**: None of the methods achieve the target <0.9° mentioned in the original paper. This suggests:
   - Need for larger, more diverse training dataset
   - More sophisticated CNN architectures
   - Better ground truth illuminant estimation

### Recommendations for Improvement

#### 1. **Dataset Enhancement**
- Collect 1000+ diverse images from SimpleCube++ dataset
- Use proper ground truth illuminants (not synthetic)
- Include various lighting conditions and scene types

#### 2. **CNN Architecture Improvements**
- Implement log-chroma histogram approach (FFCC)
- Add attention mechanisms
- Use pre-trained features (transfer learning)
- Implement ensemble methods

#### 3. **Training Improvements**
- Use curriculum learning (easy to hard samples)
- Implement focal loss for hard examples
- Add more sophisticated data augmentation
- Use learning rate scheduling

#### 4. **Evaluation Enhancements**
- Test on standard benchmarks (ColorChecker dataset)
- Cross-validation across different camera sensors
- Temporal consistency for video sequences

### Current Status
✅ Comprehensive classical algorithm comparison
✅ Improved CNN with data augmentation
✅ Batch evaluation infrastructure
⚠️ Target performance not yet achieved (need <0.9°)

### Next Steps
1. Implement FFCC algorithm
2. Create larger synthetic dataset
3. Add ensemble voting
4. Optimize hyperparameters
